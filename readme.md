# Dashfoss

Dashfoss is a Xamarin based front end mobile application for Tumblr, as an alternative to the official apps. It currently supports Android, but theoretically will be compatible for iOS when Apple roll out sideloading apps. I will not be adding this app to the App store as it stands.

This app uses the official Tumblr V2 API, using a modified version of [TumblrSharp](https://github.com/piedoom/TumblrSharp). TumblrSharp uses the [MIT License](https://github.com/piedoom/TumblrSharp/blob/master/LICENSE).

Dashfoss is in very early alpha. It can currently:

- Display most kinds of tumblr post (ie. text/html/video/image/question/audio/embeds/etc)
- Viewing tags on posts
- Display your dashboard
- Navigate to individual blogs
- Like/unlike posts
- Show liked posts
- Infinite scroll

Limitations:

- **No post creation**
- No reblogging
- No replying or viewing replies
- No searching
- No tag searching

This project was made as a personal project, but you can use it too if you want :) 

To build:

- Open the project .sln in visual studio
- Smack the build button

**Do not put this application or any derived application on any app store without my direct written permission**, as it may break the app store's TOS. You are of course allowed to build it, modify it and run it on your own devices however you want.

This application is presented without warranty or any guarantees of performance, stability and security. It is a personal open-source project by one person.
